# Tutor Management System

## Problem
Manual tracking of tutoring sessions, payments, and scheduling does not scale, limiting visibility into revenue, capacity, and operational efficiency for education services.

## Data
Relational data representing students, tutors, subjects, sessions, enrollments, packages, payments, and tutor expertise.  
The system is modeled using nine normalized relational tables designed to support scheduling, billing, and analytics.

## Methods
- Entity-relationship (ER) modeling
- MySQL 8.0 schema design
- Normalization (3NF)
- Business rules enforced via constraints and triggers
- Indexing and query optimization
- Analytical SQL queries for operational metrics

## Outcome / Insight
Delivered a robust, normalized database that supports reliable reporting on revenue, enrollment, and tutor capacity, demonstrating how strong data modeling underpins trustworthy analytics.

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to translate real-world operational needs into scalable, analytics-ready data infrastructure — a core requirement for applied data science roles close to business operations.
